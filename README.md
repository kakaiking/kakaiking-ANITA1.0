# Anita IDE - Agentic AI Coding Assistant

Anita is an agentic AI IDE powered by DeepSeek via OpenRouter. It features a modern, premium UI inspired by Cursor and Antigravity.

## Features
- **Agentic Workflow**: Planner, Coder, and Tester agents coordinate to fulfill your requests.
- **DeepSeek Integration**: Uses OpenRouter for high-quality, coding-specific AI models.
- **Monaco Editor**: High-performance editor with syntax highlighting and multi-tab support.
- **Secure File System**: All operations are confined to your selected workspace.
- **Token Tracking**: Monitor your API usage in real-time.
- **Command Approval**: Safety first — all terminal commands require user's explicit consent.

## Installation

2. **Setup**:

   cd anita-app
   npm install

## Usage

1. **Launch**: On first launch, select a workspace folder and enter your **OpenRouter API Key** in the settings panel.
2. **Composer**: Use the right sidebar's composer to describe what you want to build (e.g., "Create a simple React dashboard with a sidebar").
3. **Approve**: Review the plan and tasks generated by the Planner agent. Click **Start Execution**.
4. **Monitor**: Watch the agent execute tasks, write files, and suggest terminal commands.
5. **Test**: Use the **Test & Fix** feature to verify the results.
