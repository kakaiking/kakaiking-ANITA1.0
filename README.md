## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Workspace Setup
On the first launch, Anita will prompt you to **Select a Workspace**. Choose the root folder of the project you want to work on. Anita will only operate within this directory for safety.

### 2. Configure API Keys
Click the **Gear Icon (Settings)** in the bottom left.
- Enter your **OpenRouter API Key**. 
- Choose your preferred chat model (e.g., `deepseek/deepseek-chat`).

### 3. The Chat Experience
Use the **Chat Panel** on the right for:
- Asking technical questions.
- Explaining existing code.
- Brainstorming architectures.

### 4. High-Octane "Agent Mode"
When you're ready to build a feature:
1. Click the **Agent Icon** in the sidebar.
2. Describe your goal in the composer (e.g., *"Implement a Firebase authentication flow with login/signup pages"*).
3. Anita will enter **Planning Phase**. Review the generated plan.
4. Click **Start Execution**. Anita will then create files, install dependencies, and run commands while keeping you in the loop for approvals.

### 5. Auto-Repair
If an agent command fails or a file cannot be written, Anita's **Repair Mode** will automatically analyze the error and suggest a corrective path forward.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- `main.js`: Core Electron process handling file system access, terminal spawning, and AI proxies.
- `preload.js`: Secure context bridge between the web app and OS.
- `index.html`: Entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.js`: The heart of the UI, managing state, agents, and React components.
- `src/styles/index.css`: Comprehensive design system and CSS variables.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
- **Workspace Isolation**: Anita can only read/write files within your explicitly selected workspace.
- **Command Control**: No terminal command runs without your click.
- **Local Storage**: Your API keys and settings are stored locally on your machine using `electron-store`.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Advanced Agentic Workflow
Anita doesn't just chat; it executes. It uses a sophisticated **Planner-Coder-Tester** architecture:
- **Planner Agent**: Analyzes your request and builds a detailed implementation plan.
- **Coder Agent**: Executes tasks, creates files, and writes high-quality code.
- **Tester/Repair Agent**: Automatically detects errors, suggests fixes, and ensures your project runs smoothly.

### 🤖 Hybrid Model Intelligence
- **DeepSeek Integration**: Leverages OpenRouter for lightning-fast, high-reasoning coding assistance in the chat.
- **Agentic Powerhouse**: Deeply integrated with **Meta Llama 3.1 70B** for robust, reliable plan execution and auto-repair.

### 💻 Professional Grade Editor
- **Monaco Editor Support**: The same core powering VS Code, providing industry-standard IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and multi-tab management.
- **Real-Time Workspace Sync**: Seamlessly navigate and edit your local project files.

### 🛠️ Integrated Smart Terminal
- **Safety Approvals**: Every terminal command generated by the AI requires your explicit consent before execution.
- **Context-Aware**: The terminal tracks your working directory and handles long-running processes (like `npm start`) with ease.

### 🎨 Premium Aesthetic & Customization
- **Modern UI**: A sleek, dark-mode-first interface with **Glassmorphism** effects, inspired by the best developer tools.
- **Typography**: Uses modern fonts like *Inter* and *Outfit* for a crisp, readable coding experience.
- **Tailored Themes**: Personalize your chat experience with custom backgrounds, bubble colors, and themes.
